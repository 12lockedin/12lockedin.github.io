# Welcome

I'm Felipe Agustín. I studied industrial engineering. 

I enjoy most of my free time with my girlfriend. When she's had enough of me for the day, I try to fill the void with other stuff.

The "other stuff" involves everything that feeds my curiosity.
Technology, AI, climate change, playing piano, reading, "creating" things, exploring nature, medicine, money, invetments...
I also think every now and then... (If I were always to think I'll be doing much better).

## What you will find here

I know that the list above sums up almost every area of knowledge possible, which means nothing.
To narrow down:
- Latest tech advancements.
- Philosophical ramblings about human nature and psychology.
- Bussiness and investments.


## Purpose
The main reason for this blog express thoughts some people might agree with and might find helpful.
I do not intend to be the "cleverest", just putting out the things I write for myself to the world, to see what people thinks.
